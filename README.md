# ECoG
NMA Group Project


## Current Plan

1) Apply a power spectrum analysis to within-subject data
2) Explore machine learning analysis to specific bands (Gamma)
3) Apply an interpolation of the electrodes
4) Explore machine learning analysis to the interpolated representation
5) Explore between-subject equivalence with interpolation and electrode pruning
6) Apply machine learning analysis to between-subject interpolation
7) Project interpolation back onto standardized brain representation for visualization
